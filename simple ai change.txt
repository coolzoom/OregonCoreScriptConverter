1. loop script folder and list all cpp file

2, filter those file that has below content inside, those are the "old" structure

	void AddSC*
	{
		*RegisterSelf();
	}

3, get the script name from the AddSC portion, do the cpp that has only 1 script name for now, leave those cpp which have several scripts later.
   do those has only ->Name, ->GetAI, ->RegisterSelf,
	void AddSC*
	{
		*->Name = "script_name";
	}

4, find script start and stop point using script_name as key word, if no match find, list and may do it manually

	struct script_nameAI : public ScriptedAI
	{
	}
	CreatureAI* GetAI_script_name(Creature* pCreature)
	{
		return new script_nameAI (pCreature);
	}

	then include it into a new portion

	class script_name: public CreatureScript
	{
	public:
		script_name() : CreatureScript("script_name") { }
		

	};
	
5, replace original content inside void AddSC* to new

	void AddSC*
	{
		new script_name(); //*->Name = "script_name";
	}
6, maual check
