this step will process those file which has only 1 script per file and replace the function name to hooks then do similar as simple ai replacement

1. get all hooks from AddSC module

newscript->pGossipHello = &GossipHello_custom_example;
      
pGossipHello 
pGossipSelect 
pAreaTrigger 
pGOHello 
pQuestAccept 
GoQuestComplete 
pChooseReward 
GetInstanceData 
pItemUse 
pEffectDummyCreature 
pQuestComplete 
pGOQuestAccept 
pGOHello  
pGOSelect 


2, make a mapping table 

{"pGossipHello", "OnGossipHello"},

3, replace functions according to the mapping

from
bool GossipSelect_custom_example(Player* pPlayer, Creature* pCreature, uint32 uiSender, uint32 uiAction)

to 
bool OnGossipSelect(Player* player, Creature* creature, uint32 /*sender*/, uint32 action)
